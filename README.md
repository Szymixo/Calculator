# My first calculator
Hello everybody. Today i'm gonna show you, my first console application in C#.

# How it works ?
When the program start, you can see a messeage "Type your first number". Then type first number.
In second number do this same.

Now you can see four messages:
x + x = x | x - x = x | x * x = x | x / x = x

"x" is your number.
