# My first calculator
Hello everybody. Today i'm gonna show you, my first console application in C#.

# How it works ?
When the program start, you can see a messeage "Type your first number". Then type first number.
In second number do this same.

Now you can see four messages:
x + x = x
x - x = x
x * x = x
x / x = x

When "x" is your numbers.
